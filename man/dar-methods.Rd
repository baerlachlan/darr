\title{Calculate Differential Allelic Representation (DAR)}
\usage{
dar(props, contrasts, winSize = 5)

\S4method{dar}{GRangesList,matrix}(props, contrasts, winSize = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{props}{A GRangesList containing a summary of normalised allele counts
(i.e. as proportions) at each range.
Each element of the list represents a distinct sample group}

\item{contrasts}{A contrast matrix specifying which sample groups to
to calculate DAR between.
Each column must represent a single contrast, and rows represent the levels
(i.e. sample groups) to be contrasted.
The two levels involved with each contrast should be specified with
\code{1} and \code{-1}}

\item{winSize}{integer specifying the number of ranges to include in the
elastic sliding window used for smoothing the DAR metric}
}
\value{
A GRangesList containing DAR values at each overlapping range
between the contrasted sample groups.
Each element of the list represents a comparison between two sample groups.
}
\description{
Calculate DAR between two sample groups
}
